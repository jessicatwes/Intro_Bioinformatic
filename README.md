# NGS and Bioinformatic Introduction
The field of bioinformatic involves a combination of biological knowledge in addition to computational to gain practical insights about biology. It includes collection of data, storage and retrieval, quality control, transformation or  manipulation, as well as modelling of data for analysis, visualization or prediction through the use of software and algorithms.

This repository will cover some of the basic tools and package to convert your raw DNA sequencing data into a format that can be used to explore and gain data insight anout human health. My primary work is in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), hence this repository will be primary using NGS datasets.

## Relevant databases and repository
Bioinformatic databases where you can retrieve datasets
* [NBCI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
* [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
* [Encode](https://www.encodeproject.org/)

## Other resources
I have been involved in the [Short Read Workshop](https://biodatasci.colorado.edu/shortread/) put on by the Dowell aNd Allen (DNA) laboratory at University of Colorado Boulder. This workshop teaches participants the basic of working with NGS datasets including fundamental shell/Unix scripting. If you are not familiar with NGS but want to learn, I recommend checking out their previous workshop or whatching videos from their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dnalabshortreadsequencingw7972).
