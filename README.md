# Bioinformatic introduction
The field of bioinformatic involves a combination of biological knowledge in addition to computational skills. This repository will cover some of the basic tools and package to convert your raw data into a format that can be used to explore and gain data insight. My primary work was in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), hence this repository will be primary using NGS datasets.

## Relevant databases and repository
Bioinformatic databases where you can retrieve datasets
* [NBCI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
* [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
* [Encode](https://www.encodeproject.org/)
* [Cistrome](http://cistrome.org/)

## Other resources
I have been involved in the [Short Read Workshop](https://biodatasci.colorado.edu/shortread/) put on by the Dowell aNd Allen (DNA) laboratory at University of Colorado Boulder. This workshop teaches participants the basic of working with NGS datasets including fundamental shell/Unix scripting. If you are not familiar with NGS but want to learn, I recommend checking out their previous workshop or whatching videos from their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dnalabshortreadsequencingw7972).
