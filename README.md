# Bioinformatic introduction and pipelines
The field of bioinformatic involves a combination of biological knowledge in addition to computational skills. This repository will cover some of the basic tools and package to convert your raw data into a format that can be used to explore and gain data insight. 

## Relevant databases and repository

## Other resources
The Dowell aNd Allen (DNA) laboratory hold an annual [Short Read Workshop](https://biodatasci.colorado.edu/shortread/) that teaches student the baasic of working with NGS datasets including fundamental shell/Unix scripting. If you are not familiar with NGS, I recommend checking out their previous workshop or [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dnalabshortreadsequencingw7972).
